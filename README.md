## 🌟 Inspiration

Growing up in Faisalabad, we saw talented local professionals—plumbers, tutors, caretakers, carpenters—struggle to find work and recognition, while residents juggled fragmented referral chains and unverified service providers. Aasani was born to bridge that gap: a digital home where service seekers find vetted workers, and mazdoors gain security, training opportunities, and a path to dignified livelihood.
